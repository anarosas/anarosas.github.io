After 2 years of working with Elixir, it's time for me to go back to Ruby.
Why, you may ask.
Nothing against Elixir, I like it, it's powerful, and it's a different type of programming. And I'm open to continue learning and working with it.

But, I do miss feeling comfortable. I miss using tools I know, the community, and especially, I miss feeling fast. This is likely related to the context I was in. I was learning Elixir while developing a brand new product and building a company, while... let's leave this story for another day.

I've worked with Ruby since 2010, had some time where I was working mostly with AngularJS, then back to Ruby, then focused on Management, then Elixir, and now that I have some unexpected free time, I would love to get back to it and experiment again, but who knows where I might get along the way.

I'm very outdated in the Ruby world. I will take this opportunity to start blogging and share my journey. It's been on my mind for a long time, but never really found the time or energy to do so.

Let's see what happens!
